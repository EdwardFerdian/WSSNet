# WSSNet

Spatiotemporal Aortic Wall Shear Stress estimation from 4D Flow MRI
--



This is an implementation of the paper [WSSNet: Aortic wall shear stress estimation using deep learning on 4D Flow MRI] using Tensorflow 2.2.0. 


WSSNet predicts WSS vectors per time frame from 4D Flow MRI dataset. It allows accurate prediction of WSS from native MRI resolution.
